#Blueprint theme for Koken

Blueprint is a simple, bare bones theme for [Koken](http://koken.me). The theme isn't intended for actual use, but rather as a learning tool for web designers and developers interested in building their own themes. The theme includes examples of all types of data being published and is fully commented throughout to explain how it all works.

###Installation

Once downloaded, add the “blueprint” folder to Koken's `koken/storage/themes` directory to see it in action.
